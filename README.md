# Calculator with Button and Keyboard Input

This project is a simple calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports both button click events and keyboard inputs for performing basic arithmetic operations.

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Clear Screen**: Ability to reset the input using the "AC" button or the "Escape" key.
- **Delete**: Delete the last entered character using the "DEL" button or the "Backspace" key.
- **Evaluate**: Calculate the result using the "=" button or the "Enter" key.
- **Keyboard Support**: Numbers (`0-9`), operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), and keyboard shortcuts for clearing (`ESC`), deleting (`Backspace`), and calculating (`Enter`).
